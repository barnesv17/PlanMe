        This application was created by Virginia Barnes, Kenneth Lee, and Q as
        an Introdution to Information Technology term project to demonstrate our
        mastery of HTML/CSS, javascript, and user design.

        The inspiration for the application came about when Virginia had to plan
        her sorority formal. She had to call each venue to see if the space was
        large enough and fit her budget. A website such as this would have saved
        her a lot of time and could save the time of any persons or group on RPI's
        campus or in the Troy, NY, area who is planning a large event.
